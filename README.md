# Maintained

Monitoring open source projects activity.

## Metrics

Done:

- Issue average & median closing time (collaborators issues excluded)

Ideas:

- Take into account pull requests? (are they already? need to check GitHub's API)
- Issue average/median acknowledgement time (i.e. first comment after the issue was open)
- Regularity of releases (i.e. average release delay)
